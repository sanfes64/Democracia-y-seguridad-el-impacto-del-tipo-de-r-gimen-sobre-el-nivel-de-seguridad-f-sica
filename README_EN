Democracy and Security: The Impact of Regime Type on the Level of Physical Security

This repository contains the complete replication package of the undergraduate thesis “Democracy and Security: The Impact of Regime Type on the Level of Physical Security” carried out at Universidad Torcuato Di Tella by Santiago Festa, with Carlos Gervasoni as advisor.

The objective of the work is to evaluate how an increase in the level of democracy can generate an increase in the level of physical security. For this, data from V-Dem, GBD, WB, UNDP, and WEO among others are used.

The replication package includes the codes to create the database, create electoral democracy indices using V-Dem indicators, analyze univariate and bivariate descriptive statistics, analyze the assumptions of the difference-in-differences (DiD) model, and run the OLS and DiD models.

The codes are written in R and must be executed manually, since several steps require user review. This includes both an analysis with the original V-Dem indices and an alternative reconstruction of the electoral democracy index to avoid problems of conceptual circularity.
